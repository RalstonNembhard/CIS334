Can we please schedule a Tech to go onsite, to check both DD and CC because, I do not believe the DD Controller would have any impact on the lanes, unless it's switched over to Primary?Additional Comments from Pomeroy:2025-01-22 16:33:48 - Willow Hartness (Additional comments)Was able to login to both the CC and DD controllers. DD controller has a system uptime of 170 days and CC has 70 days. System messages report that both controllers are leaving the LAN. It shows both controllers being physically removed and reconnected to the LAN. This appears to be network related. Sending to a tech to check all ports/connections on the controller to make sure its not a physical issue with the controllers.Additional Work Notes from Pomeroy:2025-01-22 16:33:48 - Willow Hartness (Work notes)*2025-01-22T21:33:58ZIBM CONTROLLER 4900C45"
